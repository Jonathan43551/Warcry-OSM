# Warcry-OSM
Light set designed for OSM based on Audiorfreq - Warcry

------
I picked the following colors: Yellow, Blue, GhostBlue, Red, GhostRed. This is my first attempt at describing audiofreq's version of hardstyle with light. 7 modes that are mostly different, I'm a big fan of mode 1 on my fingers and 5 or 6 on my thumbs. Mode 7 on all of the lights is pretty cool as well.

- //STROBE (8,6) to STROBE (8,4) @ SHAKE 
- // Mode 1	// Prime A //BLUE and GHSTBLUE 
- // Mode 1	// Prime B //RED YELLOW and BLUE

- //STROBE (8,6) to STROBE (8,4) @ SHAKE (Reduced Sensitivity) 
- // Mode 2	// Prime A //BLUE and GHSTBLUE
- // Mode 2	// Prime B //RED YELLOW and BLUE
 
- //STROBE (8,6) to STROBE (8,6) @ SHAKE 
- // Mode 3	// Prime A //YELLOW HILL 
- // Mode 3	// Prime B //GHSTBLUE HILL
 
- //STROBE (6,2) to STROBE (8,6) @ SHAKE (Reduced Sensitivity) 
- // Mode 4	// Prime A //YELLOW HILL 
- // Mode 4	// Prime B //GHSTBLUE HILL
 
- //STROBE (8,6) to TRACE (3,25) @ SHAKE 
- // Mode 5	// Prime A //YELLOW HILL 
- // Mode 5	// Prime B //GHSTBLUE HILL
 
- //STROBE (8,6) to STROBE (8,6) @ SHAKE 
- // Mode 6	// Prime A //BLUE and GHSTRED 
- // Mode 6	// Prime B //RED YELLOW and BLUE
 
- //STROBE (6,2) to TRACE (3,30) @ SHAKE 
- // Mode 7	// Prime A //RED YELLOW and BLUE 
- // Mode 7	// Prime B //GHSTBLUE with BLUE and GHSTRED

The first two bundles are limited to those I made, the default 8-12 modes are still on the chip and can be found in the other 3 modes:
 - 7,    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      // Bundle 1,2 Warcry
 - 12,   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,   // Bundle 3,4,5
